An effort to remaster, rebalance and (re)expand the mod Ogniem i Miecziem, for Rome Total War.
This version is compatible with Rome Remastered and contains plenty of new factions and new units, as well as improved graphics. Custom battles are playable.
For now, it has been abandoned. I encourage anyone willing to continue it to do so. I'd also appreciate if you'd let me know. Maybe I could help you too.

Design Philosophy:
1) 1562 to 1721 timeline, divided into four Eras: Early Modern (1562-1601), Pike and Shot (1601, 1659), Reformed Warfare (1660-1701), Enlightened Warfare (1701-1721)
2) A combat system inspired by Byzantine Game's "Pike and Shot: Campaigns". All units' stats are built through a xls file which I included in the repository.
3) Give justice to every faction, no matter how small. Dispel stereotypes and historic propaganda.
4) Provide alternative-history path to nations, inspired directly by "Divide and Conquer" (Medieval II) and "The New Order" (Hearts of Iron IV).


The mod includes units and assets from KLA's "European Wars". Remember to credit him.
